# IBM Quantum Global Summer School Projects 2025 ⚛️

This repository contains my completed coding labs from the **Qiskit Global Summer School (QGSS) 2025**, hosted by **IBM Quantum**. The program provided a deep dive into the foundations and frontiers of quantum computing through a mix of theory and hands-on coding challenges using Qiskit and real quantum hardware.

## 🧪 Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Quantum Fundamentals — Superposition, Interference & Entanglement
In this introductory lab, I implemented and visualized the foundational principles of quantum computing:
- **Superposition** using single-qubit gates
- **Interference** via Hadamard transformations
- **Measurement probabilities**
- **Entanglement** through Bell state circuits

### Lab 2: Quantum Noise & Error Mitigation in Max-Cut Optimization
This lab tackled the challenges of **quantum noise** in near-term devices. I applied error mitigation techniques to solve a small **Max-Cut problem**, including:
- Transpilation with optimization levels
- Readout error mitigation
- Noise-aware circuit folding
- Execution on real IBM quantum hardware

### Lab 3: Simulating Quantum Chemistry with Qiskit
I simulated real molecular systems using a quantum-classical hybrid workflow:
- Quantum simulation of molecular orbitals
- Hartree-Fock and CCSD references
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Integration with PySCF and Qiskit Nature

### Lab 4: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) & Fault Tolerance
This advanced lab focused on protecting quantum information:
- Classical error-correcting code foundations
- Stabilizer formalism and syndrome decoding
- Implementation of the **Steane code**, **Toric code**, and **QLDPC-inspired Gross code**
- Parity-check matrix rank analysis and syndrome measurement simulation
